## Description

**Motor contactors and starters** are core components in industrial motor control systems. A **contactor** is an electromechanical switch used to control high-current loads (such as motors), while a **starter** combines a contactor with an **overload relay** to provide both control and protection.

---

## Core Concepts

### üîπ What is it?
- **Contactor**: Electrically controlled switch that energizes or de-energizes a motor or load.
- **Starter**: Assembly consisting of a **contactor + overload relay**.
- Used to **start/stop**, and **protect motors** from overload or stall conditions.
- Control logic is usually wired to pushbuttons or PLC outputs.

### üîπ How it works
- **Control voltage** is applied to the **coil** (A1‚ÄìA2).
- Energized coil creates a magnetic field ‚Üí pulls in the armature ‚Üí closes main contacts (L1-T1, L2-T2, L3-T3).
- When control voltage is removed, spring returns armature ‚Üí contacts open ‚Üí motor turns off.
- **Overload relay** senses overcurrent. If triggered, it **opens NC auxiliary contact**, cutting control circuit to stop the motor.

### üîπ When to Use
- Applications requiring **simple on/off motor control**:
  - Fans, pumps, conveyors, mixers, compressors.
- Use a **starter** when:
  - You need **motor overload protection**.
- Use **only a contactor** when:
  - The load is non-motor (e.g., heaters) or protection is handled externally (e.g., in VFD).

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting & Diagnostics

| Symptom                       | Likely Cause                    | Diagnostic Step                            | Tool(s) Needed     |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Contactor doesn‚Äôt pull in    | No control voltage / open coil  | Measure voltage at coil terminals (A1‚ÄìA2)   | Multimeter         |
| Contactor clicks but motor dead | Worn contacts or wiring issue | Check voltage on T1/T2/T3 when energized    | Multimeter         |
| Starter trips immediately    | Overload too low or jammed load | Measure motor current & check OLR setting   | Clamp meter         |
| Coil buzzing or chattering   | Low voltage / mechanical fault  | Confirm proper coil voltage & alignment     | Multimeter         |
| Motor won‚Äôt restart after trip | OLR still tripped              | Reset OLR and investigate root cause        | Visual + Manual    |

> üí° **Pro Tip:** Always check 95-96 (NC contact) continuity on the overload relay ‚Äî if open, the overload has tripped even if the contactor looks normal.

## üìè Specifications & Parameters

| Parameter         | Typical Value/Range         | Notes                                    |
|------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Coil Voltage      | 24 VDC / 120 VAC / 230 VAC  | Match to control system (PLC/pushbutton) |
| Contact Rating    | 9A to 500A+                 | Based on motor FLA                       |
| Overload Range    | Adjustable via dial         | Set to match motor nameplate FLA         |
| Aux Contacts      | NO / NC                     | Used for interlocks and feedback         |

## üìê Wiring & Diagrams

```plaintext
Power Circuit:
L1 ---[ Contactor ]--- T1 -----> Motor
L2 ---[ Contactor ]--- T2 -----> Motor
L3 ---[ Contactor ]--- T3 -----> Motor

Control Circuit:
L (hot) --[ STOP (NC) ]--[ START (NO) ]--[ OLR 95-96 (NC) ]--[ Coil A1 ]
                                              |
                                              +--[ A2 ]-- Neutral
```


- **STOP** is NC: breaks circuit to stop motor.
- **START** is NO: latches control circuit via auxiliary contact.
- **OLR NC contact (95-96)** interrupts circuit on overload.

## üìé Reference Notes

- **NEC Article 430**: Motor control and protection requirements.
- **IEC 60947-4-1**: Standard for low-voltage motor starters and contactors.
- Overload relays are typically **class 10** (trips in ~10s at 600% FLA).
- Starters are often part of **MCC buckets** or standalone **control panels**.
