## Description

Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) is a safety procedure used to ensure that machines are properly shut off and cannot be started up again before maintenance or servicing is completed. It protects workers from unexpected energization or release of hazardous energy.

---

## Core Concepts

### 🔹 What is it?
> - LOTO is a formal system for controlling hazardous energy.  
> - Involves isolating energy sources and applying locks & tags.  
> - Required by OSHA 29 CFR 1910.147 in the US.

### 🔹 How it works
> - Identify all energy sources (electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic, mechanical).  
> - Shut down equipment.  
> - Isolate energy sources (disconnect switches, valves).  
> - Apply lock and tag.  
> - Release stored energy (bleed air, discharge capacitors).  
> - Verify zero energy state before starting work.

### 🔹 When to Use
> - During maintenance, cleaning, adjustments.  
> - Anytime removing guards or exposing hazardous parts.  
> - Not typically used for minor tool changes if alternative protection is in place.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting & Diagnostics

| Symptom                    | Likely Cause                  | Diagnostic Step                     | Tool(s) Needed  |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Power still present         | Incomplete isolation         | Test each terminal point for zero voltage | Multimeter |
| Tag found but no lock       | Procedure violation          | Audit lock ownership, retrain team | LOTO log, checklist |

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** Always attempt to start the equipment after lockout to verify it does NOT run.

## 📏 Specifications & Parameters

| Parameter         | Typical Value/Range | Notes                         |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Padlock diameter   | ~1/4" shackle       | Sized to lock hasp holes      |
| Tag strength       | 50 lbs pull min     | OSHA requirement              |
| Lock color         | Red or standardized | Per facility policy           |

## 📐 Wiring & Diagrams

```
[No wiring - LOTO is mechanical & procedural]
```
Use schematics to identify disconnects and control power sources.

---

## 📎 Reference Notes

- OSHA 29 CFR 1910.147 Lockout/Tagout standard.  
- NFPA 70E covers electrical safety.  
- Facility-specific LOTO procedures must be documented.
