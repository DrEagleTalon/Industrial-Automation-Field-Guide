## Specifications & Parameters

| Parameter          | Typical Value / Range      | Notes                               |
|---------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Control Voltage     | 24 VDC, 120 VAC, etc.     | Match to PLC or relay logic         |
| Contact Rating      | 9A, 12A, 25A, etc.        | Sized to motor FLA                  |
| Overload Range      | Adjustable (e.g. 5-10A)   | Match to motor nameplate current    |

## Troubleshooting & Diagnostics

| Symptom                 | Likely Cause                  | Diagnostic Step                     | Tool(s) Needed   |
|--------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------|
| Motor wonâ€™t start         | Contactor not pulling in     | Measure control voltage at coil     | Multimeter       |
| Overload tripping         | Phase imbalance or heat      | Clamp each phase current            | Clamp meter      |

**Field Tip:** In hot environments, overloads may trip at lower currents. Always check your enclosure ventilation and dust buildup.

---

## Field Checklist

- [ ] Coil voltage matches control circuit spec
- [ ] Overload relay set correctly for motor FLA
- [ ] Aux contacts properly wired for feedback
- [ ] Control & power terminals torqued to spec
- [ ] Verified LOTO performed before any service

---

## Reference Notes

- Refer to NEC Article 430 for motor protection requirements.
- Manufacturer data sheets (Allen Bradley, Siemens, Schneider).
- IEC 60947 series for low-voltage switchgear.
